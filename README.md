## Project Description
This is an iOS music theory training app written in Swift with AudioKit.

There are four main functions:
1. Sight Reading.
2. Sight Singing.
3. Interval Dictation.
4. Chord Progression Dictation.

**THE APP IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. SINCE THIS IS A PERSONAL PROJECT, I DO NOT ACCEPT ANY PULL REQUEST AT THE MOMENT.**
